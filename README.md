# Sephora and Ulta ETL

## Project Proposal

Our group set out to create a user-friendly tool/database to address the need of consumers to identify the different ingredients that make
up the personal hygiene/beauty products that we as consumers use daily. Whether the consumer has sensitive skin, dry skin, oily hair, allergies to a specific ingredient or simply wants to search by price or peer recommendations, our tool seeks to empower the user to be able to navigate the various product offerings with the confidence that this tool has done the homework for them and has narrowed the products to those that fit the customerâ€™s needs.

### Initial Project Set-Up

When we visualized what we wanted to accomplish with the project and what the timeline was, we initially set out to obtain various variables (skin type, top grossing products, etc.) on a wider set of products/product categories (mascara, eye brows etc.), on two websites (sephora.com and ulta.com). Given our time constraints however, we decided to downscale the project to a narrower product and variable set. Importantly, however given the way that we set up the code, the project can easily be modified and scaled to extract any additional products and variables that the user may need/want by
changing the search list.

Given the quick turnaround (five days from start to finish), our timeline was compressed. As a group we agreed that all the web-scrapping needed to be done by Monday (day - 2), all the data transformation completed by Tuesday (day - 3), to go live and complete documentation by Wednesday (day - 4), and on Thursday analyze, submit and present our findings to the class.
