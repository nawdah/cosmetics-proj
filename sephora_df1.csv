 Blossom & Bloom?äó Ginseng + Biotin Volumizing Conditioner utilizes natural volumizing agents to promote fuller, thicker-looking hair from the inside out.

The Briogeo brand was inspired by a family tradition of making natural beauty products at home in the kitchen of founder Nancy Twine. Nancy believes the answer to beautiful, healthy, and charismatic hair exists within nature's own ingredients.

 Unlike many traditional shampoos, the non-lathering Be Gentle, Be Kind?äó Avocado + Quinoa Co?ÇöWash is so hydrating, you typically won?ÇÖt need to follow up with a conditioner. The formula?ÇÖs high-slip nature makes for easy detangling and manageability, creating hair that feels soft, hydrated, and tangle-free. It is recommended for those with textured, thick, coarse, curly, or dry hair, and even helps to extend color?Çönourishing chemically-treated, relaxed, or keratin-treated hair. Hair that?ÇÖs thick is typically on the dryer side of the spectrum, which tends to mean hair oils don?ÇÖt spread as intensely through the hair shaft as with thinner or finer hair. Contrary to sudsing shampoos?Çöwhich can cause higher levels of oil loss?Çöthis super-creamy cleanser leaves hair looking luxuriously quenched.

Drunk Elephant difference:Drunk Elephant is clean, but in their opinion, ""clean"" is not enough when it comes to caring for skin. They make ""Clean Compatible"" skincare. Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin?ÇÖs health or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulations. They never take into account an ingredient?ÇÖs synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on biocompatibility. You won?ÇÖt find what they call the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical sunscreens, fragrances/dyes, and SLS) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see, and when entirely removed from one?ÇÖs routine, (""a clean break""), skin can reset and return to a healthy, balanced state. It is equally, if not more, important what they leave out of the products as what they put in. This ingredient-elimination diet (think Whole30 for your face) inspired the #barewithus Instagram movement, a collection of bare-faced selfies chronicling the Drunk Elephant journeys of people who have found success using the line and renewed confidence in their own skin. When formulating their products, Drunk Elephant focuses on biocompatibility, pH levels, and safety, always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels and remain respectful and always supportive of skin?ÇÖs acid mantle.Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.Clean at SephoraClean at Sephora is formulated without a list of over 50 ingredients, including sulfates (SLS and SLES), parabens, phthalates, and more.

Drunk Elephant,Virgin Marula Antioxidant Face Oil,face moisturizer,4.5,,,,72,"What it is:  A facial oil rich in critical antioxidants and omega 6 and 9, Virgin Marula Antioxidant Oil Face Oil moisturizes, nurtures, and balances while restoring a youthful glow.Skin Type: Normal, Dry, Combination, and Oily Skincare Concerns:  Fine Lines and Wrinkles, Dryness, and Dullness and Uneven Texture Formulation:  OilHighlighted Ingredients:- Sclerocarya Birrea (Marula) Seed Oil: Super-absorbable oil, high in critical antioxidants tocopherol (vitamin E), tocotrienol, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and omegas 6 and 9, helps moisturize and nurture skin.Ingredient Callouts: This product is vegan and cruelty-free.What Else You Need to Know: Untouched by any artificial chemical or fragrance, this highly absorbable oil quickly sinks in to diminish appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Appropriate for all skin types, including very sensitive skin, this oil contains high concentrations of polyphenols to deliver antioxidant defense against pollution and free radicals.Free of essential oils, silicones, and fragrance.Drunk Elephant difference:Drunk Elephant is clean, but in their opinion, ""clean"" is not enough when it comes to caring for skin. They make ""Clean Compatible"" skincare. Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin?ÇÖs health or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulations. They never take into account an ingredient?ÇÖs synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on biocompatibility. You won?ÇÖt find what they call the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical sunscreens, fragrances/dyes, and SLS) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see, and when entirely removed from one?ÇÖs routine, (""a clean break""), skin can reset and return to a healthy, balanced state. It is equally, if not more, important what they leave out of the products as what they put in. This ingredient-elimination diet (think Whole30 for your face) inspired the #barewithus Instagram movement, a collection of bare-faced selfies chronicling the Drunk Elephant journeys of people who have found success using the line and renewed confidence in their own skin. When formulating their products, Drunk Elephant focuses on biocompatibility, pH levels, and safety, always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels and remain respectful and always supportive of skin?ÇÖs acid mantle.Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.Clinical Results: In an independent consumer testing panel of 101 women age 25 to 55:- 97% agreed Marula Oil was gentle and non-irritating, and left skin feeling moisturized- 94% agreed skin felt softer and nourished- 90% agreed skin felt rejuvenated and radiant with a healthy glowClean at SephoraClean at Sephora is formulated without a list of over 50 ingredients, including sulfates (SLS and SLES), parabens, phthalates, and more.
