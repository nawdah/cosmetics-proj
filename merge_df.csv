394,PEACH & LILY,Matcha Pudding Antioxidant Cream,moisturizer,40.0,4.5,"WHAT IT IS: Matcha isn't just for sipping! Peach & Lily's velvety Matcha Pudding Antioxidant Cream addresses real life problems. If you've ever wondered why you might be seeing premature and rapid signs of aging, you're not alone. Our skin faces increasing stress from heightened pollution, fast-paced stressful lives, excess sun exposure and lack of sleep. All of this leads to free radical damage, which can accelerate signs of aging. This indulgent formula addresses all of this by drenching skin with powerful antioxidants, creating a protective barrier to help fight free radical damage at all layers of the skin. Spiked with Matcha, Cape Lilac Extract, Niacinamide and Adenosine, skin is blasted with antioxidants and brightening and firming ingredients. The delightful pudding texture delivers deep hydration without sitting heavy on the skin. Thank you very Matcha!RECOMMENDED FOR:Dehydration (Alicia's Tip: dehydrated skin lacks moisture. Oily skin types can have dehydrated skin, too)Dark spots, uneven skin toneFine lines, wrinklesDullness, lack of radianceWHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU: There are few ingredients that rival the antioxidant density of Matcha. Peach & Lily's Matcha Pudding is packed to the brim with this super-charged antioxidant-source so that your skin gets flooded with goodness. The creamy formula is also infused with Niacinamide to help brighten dark spots and even skin tone, while fighting inflammation. Firming and lifting benefits also come courtesy of Adenosine, while Panthenol softens and Allantoin soothes. Combined with botanical extracts, this facial pudding delivers a super-sized serving of antioxidants to neutralize the almost inevitable free radical damage from daily life.THE MIND BEHIND: As the last step of a routine before SPF or makeup, Peach & Lily founder, Alicia Yoon wanted the Matcha Pudding Antioxidant Cream to also have the perfect finish. The decadent, light texture sinks right into skin, leaving it perfectly calm, with a matte glow finish (and perfectly primed for makeup). For those with oilier skin, an extra benefit is decreased shine. For those with drier skin, this cream quenches skin thirst and hydrates without being waxy, heavy or greasy.THE PEACH & LILY PROMISE: Caring for your skin can be overwhelming. You might be tired of the skincare guessing game as you try to figure out what will work for you. You want products that deliver dramatic results, but you're worried they will be too harsh or make you break out. You want delightful textures, but want to avoid chemicals and harmful ingredients. Peach & Lily is all too familiar with trial and error, trade-offs, and compromises when it comes to skincare.The innovative beauty brand created the Peach & Lily skincare collection to deliver everything you want without worries or guesswork. Pushing the limits of innovation by combining breakthrough research and proven skincare traditions, you will enjoy dramatic results, delivered in a radically safe and delightful way.

This allows the emulsifying sucrose esters in the formula to trap and blend the dissolved makeup and facial impurities with water for rinsing. Being non-comedogenic and soap-free, this formula is designed to be gentle enough for daily use, without over-drying the skin, making it suitable for all skin types.Benefits:Gently cleanses the skinRemoves makeupRemoves SPFCruelty-free & veganFormulated without alcohol, oil, silicone, nuts, or gluten","Squalane, Aqua (Water), Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Glycerin, Sucrose Stearate, Ethyl Macadamiate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sucrose Laurate, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Sucrose Dilaurate, Sucrose Trilaurate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Isoceteth-20, Sodium Polyacrylate, Tocopherol, Hydroxymethoxyphenyl Decanone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Malic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Chlorphenesin.",https://www.ulta.com/squalane-cleanser?productId=pimprod2007098,Ulta

Ingredient Callouts: This product is vegan and cruelty-free. What Else You Need to Know: Protini restores younger, revived-looking skin. Lines, wrinkles, and sun damage appear reduced and skin feels strengthened and moisturized. Think of Protini like adding protein to your smoothie. Abundant with proteins and nutrients, it replenishes and restores skin to a strong, healthy state. Formulated at an ideal pH level of 4.0. Drunk Elephant is clean, but in their opinion, ""clean"" is not enough when it comes to caring for skin. They make ""Clean Compatible"" skincare. Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical sunscreens, fragrances/dyes, and SLS) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see, and when entirely removed from one’s routine, (""a clean break""), skin can reset and return to a healthy, balanced state. It is equally, if not more, important what they leave out of the products as what they put in.

Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of our formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on its biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical screens, fragrance/dyes, and SLS,) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see. When formulating the products, they focus on pH levels and safety, and always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels.

They make “Clean Compatible”skincare. Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the “Suspicious 6” in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical sunscreens, fragrances/dyes, and SLS) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see and when entirely removed from one’s routine (“a clean break”), skin can reset and return to a healthy, balanced state. It is equally, if not more, important what we leave out of the products as what we put in. This ingredient-elimination diet inspired the #barewithus Instagram movement, a collection of bare-faced selfies chronicling the Drunk Elephant journeys of people who have found success using the line and renewed confidence in their own skin. When formulating the products, they focus on biocompatibility, pH levels, and safety, always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels and remain respectful and always supportive of skin’s acid mantle.Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free. It is also an Allure Best of Beauty award winner.This Set Contains:- 3.88 oz/ 110 g Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanse- 0.1 oz/ 3 g Bamboo Booster™ Clean at SephoraClean at Sephora is formulated without a list of over 50 ingredients, including sulfates (SLS and SLES), parabens, phthalates, and more.

Drunk Elephant difference:Drunk Elephant is clean, but in their opinion, ""clean"" is not enough when it comes to caring for skin. They make ""Clean Compatible"" skincare. Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical sunscreens, fragrances/dyes, and SLS) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see, and when entirely removed from one’s routine, (""a clean break""), skin can reset and return to a healthy, balanced state. It is equally, if not more, important what they leave out of the products as what they put in. This ingredient-elimination diet (think Whole30 for your face) inspired the #barewithus Instagram movement, a collection of bare-faced selfies chronicling the Drunk Elephant journeys of people who have found success using the line and renewed confidence in their own skin.

Juju is fragrance and soap-free and at a pH level of 6.3 to cleanse without drying or stripping.Drunk Elephant difference:Drunk Elephant is clean, but in their opinion, ""“clean""” is not enough when it comes to caring for skin. They make ""“Clean Compatible""” skincare. Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the ""“Suspicious 6""” in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical sunscreens, fragrances/dyes, and SLS) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see, and when entirely removed from one’s routine, (""“a clean break""”), skin can reset and return to a healthy, balanced state. It is equally, if not more, important what they leave out of the products as what they put in. This ingredient-elimination diet (think Whole30 for your face) inspired the #barewithus Instagram movement, a collection of bare-faced selfies chronicling the Drunk Elephant journeys of people who have found success using the line and renewed confidence in their own skin. When formulating their products, Drunk Elephant focuses on biocompatibility, pH levels, and safety, always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels and remain respectful and always supportive of skin’s acid mantle.Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.Clean at SephoraClean at Sephora is formulated without a list of over 50 ingredients, including sulfates (SLS and SLES), parabens, phthalates, and more.

Juju Bar is an ultra-mild multitasker with a 6.3 pH-level that deeply cleanses and subtly exfoliates.Drunk Elephant Difference: Drunk Elephant is clean, but in their opinion, “clean” is not enough when it comes to caring for skin. They make “Clean Compatible”skincare. Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the “Suspicious 6” in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical sunscreens, fragrances/dyes, and SLS) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see and when entirely removed from one’s routine (“a clean break”), skin can reset and return to a healthy, balanced state. It is equally, if not more, important what we leave out of the products as what we put in. This ingredient-elimination diet inspired the #barewithus Instagram movement, a collection of bare-faced selfies chronicling the Drunk Elephant journeys of people who have found success using the line and renewed confidence in their own skin. When formulating the products, they focus on biocompatibility, pH levels, and safety, always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels and remain respectful and always supportive of skin’s acid mantle.Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.This Set Contains:- 30 g/ 1 oz Travel-size Pekee Bar™- 30 g/ 1 oz Travel-size Juju BarClinical Results: In an independent consumer testing panel of 101 women ages 25 to 55 using Pekee Bar™:- 96% agreed skin was thoroughly cleansed- 92% agreed skin was clean of all makeup - 85% agreed skin felt soft and smooth - 84% found skin was firmer and more balanced- 81% found Pekee Bar™ was calming and soothing - 81% agreed skin appeared more youthfulIn an independent consumer testing panel of 101 women ages 25 to 55 using JuJu Bar:- 95% found skin felt completely cleansed of impurities and excess oil- 95% agreed skin felt balanced- 94% found it effectively exfoliated skin- 93% agreed skin looked clarified and felt healthier- 92% found skin felt softer and smoother- 92% agreed it was perfect for their skin type  Clean at SephoraClean at Sephora is formulated without a list of over 50 ingredients, including sulfates (SLS and SLES), parabens, phthalates, and more.

Contrary to most volumizing products, this non-alcohol formula harnesses the power of 95 percent naturally derived ingredients to visibly thicken hairsans the drying, sticky, or stiff after-effects that can dull and damage tresses over time.  




What else you need to know:
 This product is free of silicones, artificial fragrances, and artificial dyes. It is vegan-friendly and cruelty-free.

✔ Wavy

What it is:
 A non-lathering, conditioning cleanser that removes impurities without stripping hair of color or natural oils.
Key benefits:
- Hydrates dry, course hair
- Detangles and increases manageability
- Lifts away impurities without stripping 
If you want to know more…
 Unlike many traditional shampoos, the non-lathering Be Gentle, Be Kind™ Avocado + Quinoa Co—Wash is so hydrating, you typically won’t need to follow up with a conditioner. The formula’s high-slip nature makes for easy detangling and manageability, creating hair that feels soft, hydrated, and tangle-free. It is recommended for those with textured, thick, coarse, curly, or dry hair, and even helps to extend color—nourishing chemically-treated, relaxed, or keratin-treated hair. Hair that’s thick is typically on the dryer side of the spectrum, which tends to mean hair oils don’t spread as intensely through the hair shaft as with thinner or finer hair. Contrary to sudsing shampoos—which can cause higher levels of oil loss—this super-creamy cleanser leaves hair looking luxuriously quenched.
